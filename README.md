# Learning Flink

This is a project aimed at not how to learn Flink, but for my own purposes of learning Flink. Feel free to fork or use it in any manner.

The code would be written in Scala and hopefully everything would be Dockerized for easy reproducability. This is just a stub readme for the time being while I work on reading the documentation and decide on problems.
