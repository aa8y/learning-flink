# Learning Streaming

This is a project aimed at not how to learn different streaming technologies and to compare them. The ones which I want to test out are Flink, Spark and Beam. Feel free to fork or use it in any manner.

The code would be written in Scala and hopefully everything would be Dockerized for easy reproducability. This is just a stub readme for the time being while I work on reading the documentation and decide on problems.
